    <para>
    With this option enabled, debug messages are printed in a
    single-line format like that traditionally produced by syslog.
    The timestamp consists of an abbreviated month, space-padded date,
    and time including seconds.  This is followed by the hostname and
    the program name, with the process-ID in square brackets.

    <para>
    If <smbconfoption name="debug hires timestamp"/> is also enabled
    then an RFC5424 timestamp is used instead.
