    <para>This parameter is only relevant for filesystems that
    do not support standardized NFS4 ACLs but only a POSIX draft ACL
    implementation and which implements default ACLs like most filesystems
    on Linux. It can be used to ensure that if default ACLs
    exist on parent directories, they are always honored when creating a
    new file or subdirectory in these parent directories. The default 
    behavior is to use the unix mode specified when creating the directory. 
    Enabling this option sets the unix mode to 0777, thus guaranteeing that 
    the default directory ACLs are propagated.

    Note that using the VFS modules acl_xattr or acl_tdb which store native
    Windows as meta-data will automatically turn this option on for any
    share for which they are loaded, as they require this option to emulate
    Windows ACLs correctly.
