	<para>This option specifies the list of DNS servers that DNS requests will be
		forwarded to if they can not be handled by Samba itself.
	</para>

	<para>The DNS forwarder is only used if the internal DNS server
		in Samba is used. Port numbers can be appended by separating them from
		the address by using a colon (':').  When specifying a port, IPv6
		addresses must be enclosed in square brackets ('[' and ']'). IPv6
		forwarder addresses with no port specified, don't need the square
		brackets, and default to port 53.
