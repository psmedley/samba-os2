.Nm hxtool
.Nd PKIX command-line utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Oo Fl Fl version Oc
.Oo Fl Fl help Oc
.Op Ar sub-command
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for making certificate sigining requests (CSRs),
displaying CSRs, signing certificates, etc.
are given, then the value will be parsed and displayed using just
the self-describing nature of DER.
.Pp
All sub-commands have their own help message, shown when invoked
with the
.Fl Fl help
or
.Fl h
option.
.Pp
Supported commands:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It help
.It list-oids
.It verify
.It print
.It validate
.It certificate-copy, cc
.It ocsp-fetch
.It ocsp-verify
.It ocsp-print
.It revoke-print
.It generate-key
.It request-create
.It request-print
.It query
.It info
.It random-data
.It crypto-available
.It crypto-select
.It hex
.It certificate-sign, cert-sign, issue-certificate, ca
.It crl-sign
.El
Other sub-commands reported by the
.Nm help
sub-command are not stable or fully supported at this time.
.Sh CERTIFICATE STORES
Stores of certificates and/or keys have string names that can be
used with
.Nm 's
commands.
Sub-commands use these certificate store names to refer to files
and tokens where keys and/or certificates are to be found or
written.
For example,
.Sq FILE:/path/to/some/file .
.Pp
Use the
.Nm certificate-copy
command to copy certificates from one store to another.
This is useful for, e.g., converting DER files to PEM or
vice-versa.
.Pp
Heimdal supports a variety of certificate and key store types:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It PEM-FILE:/path
If writing, PEM will be written.
If reading, PEM will be expected.
.It DER-FILE:/path
If writing, DER will be written.
If reading, DER will be expected.
.It FILE:/path
If writing, PEM will be written.
If reading, PEM or DER will be detected.
.It PKCS12:/path
Barely supported at this time.
.It DIR:/path
OpenSSL-style hashed directory of trust anchors.
.It MEMORY:name
An in-memory only store, usually never used in
.NM 's
commands.
.It KEYCHAIN:system-anchors
On OS X this refers to the system's trust anchors.
.It KEYCHAIN:FILE:/path
On OS X this refers to an OS X keychain at the given path.
.It NULL:
An empty store.
.It PKCS11:/path/to/shared/object,slot=NUMBER
Loads the given PKCS#11 provider object and uses the token at the
given slot number.
.El
.Sh CERTIFICATES
You can validate a certificate with the
.Nm validate
sub-command, or verify a certificate and its certification path
with the
.Nm verify
sub-command.
.Pp
You can display a certificate using the
.Nm print 
sub-command:
.Pp
.Nm print
.Oo options Oc
.Ar STORE
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.Op Fl Fl content
.Op Fl Fl info
.Op Fl Fl never-fail
.Op Fl Fl pass=password
.Op Fl Fl raw-json
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl pass=password
option is for PKCS#12 and PKCS#11 stores, and if needed and not
given, will be prompted for.
Note that it's not secure to pass passwords as command-line
arguments on multi-tenant systems.
.Pp
The
.Fl Fl raw-json
option prints the certificate(s) in the given
.Ar STORE
as a JSON dump of their DER using an experimental (i.e.,
unstable) schema.
.Sh KEYS
The
.Nm generate-key
sub-command will generate a key.
.Sh CERTIFICATE SIGNING REQUESTS
The
.Nm request-create
sub-command will create a CSR.
The
.Nm request-print
sub-command will display a CSR.
.Sh CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE / CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY
The
.Nm certificate-sign
sub-command will issue a certificate.
See its usage message.
.Sh ONLINE CERTIFICATE STATUS PROTOCOL
The
.Nm ocsp-fetch
sub-command will fetch OCSP Responses for the given
certificates.
.Pp
The
.Nm ocsp-verify
sub-command will verify OCSP Responses.
.Pp
The
.Nm ocsp-print
sub-command will display OCSP Responses.
.Sh CERTIFICATE REVOCATION LIST
The
.Nm crl-sign
sub-command will add certificates to a certificate revocation
list.
