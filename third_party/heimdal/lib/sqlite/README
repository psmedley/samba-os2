This directory contains a copy of the SQLite3 amalgamation.

In order to help update this copy to newer versions of SQLite3, please
make NO changes to it that are not absolutely necessary:

 - add no features that can't be added as loadable extensions or avoided
   altogether
 - fix no bugs that can't be worked around
 - define macros via the Makefile as much as possible (-D...) rather
   than via changes to the source
 - fix absolutely no whitespace, formatting, or spelling errors
 - fix no compiler warnings (the upstream community mostly doesn't care
   to fix them) unless you're absolutely convinced that the warning(s)
   represent a serious bug(s) that is relevant to Heimdal

If you must make changes to this copy, DO:

 - have a commit just for those changes and no other changes outside
   this part of the tree

 - provide enough information in the commit message that someone else
   (or even yourself) can figure out whether and how to re-apply your
   change years later when updating to a newer version of SQLite3
