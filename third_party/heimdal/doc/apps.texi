@cindex AFS
AFS is a distributed filesystem that uses Kerberos for authentication.

@cindex OpenAFS
@cindex Arla

@subsection kafs and afslog
@cindex afslog

@manpage{afslog,1} will obtains AFS tokens for a number of cells. What cells to get
tokens for can either be specified as an explicit list, as file paths to
get tokens for, or be left unspecified, in which case will use whatever
magic @manpage{kafs,3} decides upon.

If not told what cell to get credentials for, @manpage{kafs,3} will
search for the files ThisCell and TheseCells in the locations
specified in @manpage{kafs,3} and try to get tokens for these cells
and the cells specified in $HOME/.TheseCells.

More usefully it will look at and ~/.TheseCells in your home directory
and for each line which is a cell get afs token for these cells.

The TheseCells file defines the the cells to which applications on the
local client machine should try to aquire tokens for. It must reside in
the directories searched by @manpage{kafs,3} on every AFS client machine.

The file is in ASCII format and contains one character string, the cell
name, per line. Cell names are case sensitive, but most cell names
are lower case.

See manpage for @manpage{kafs,3} for search locations of ThisCell and TheseCells.

@subsection How to get a KeyFile

@file{ktutil -k AFSKEYFILE:KeyFile get afs@@MY.REALM}

or you can extract it with kadmin

@example
kadmin> ext -k AFSKEYFILE:/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile afs@@My.CELL.NAME
@end example

You have to make sure you have a @code{des-cbc-md5} encryption type since that
is the enctype that will be converted.

@subsection How to convert a srvtab to a KeyFile

You need a @file{/usr/vice/etc/ThisCell} containing the cellname of your
AFS-cell.

@file{ktutil copy krb4:/root/afs-srvtab AFSKEYFILE:/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile}.

If keyfile already exists, this will add the new key in afs-srvtab to
KeyFile.
