.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
acquires PKIX credentials from a credential cache using the kx509
protocol, or extracts PKIX credentials stored in a credential
cache.
.Pp
Options supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar cache , Fl Fl cache= Ns Ar cache
credential cache to use (if not given, then the default will be
used).
.It Fl t Ar time-left , Fl Fl test= Ns Ar time-left
Test for there being an active and valid certificate in the
credential cache, with at least
.Ar time-left
seconds left of valid life.  If given with the
.Fl o
then the certificates in the hx509 store are tested along with
those in the credentials cache (if any).
.It Fl x , Fl Fl extract
Extract, rather than acquire credentials.
.It Fl s , Fl Fl save
save the acquired certificate and the private key used in the
given credential cache.
.It Fl o , Fl Fl out= Ns Ar hx509-store
An hx509 store specification, such as
.Va DER-FILE:/path/to/der/file ,
.Va PEM-FILE:/path/to/PEM/file ,
.Va FILE:/path/to/PEM/file ,
or
.Va PKCS12:/path/to/PKCS#12/file
into which to store any PKIX certificate and private key
(unencrypted) that may have been acquired with the kx509 protocol
and stored in the
.Ns Ar ccache.
.It Fl r Ar realm, Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm
specify the name of the realm whose kx509 service to use.
.It Fl K Ar store, Fl Fl private-key= Ns Ar store
use the private key from the given hx509 store for requesting a
certificate.
.It Fl C Ar csr, Fl Fl csr= Ns Ar certificate-request
specify a CSR to use, which must be a string of the form
PKCS10:filename and which must contain the DER encoding of a
PKCS#10 certification request.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm hxtool(1)
command can be used to create private keys and CSRs.
