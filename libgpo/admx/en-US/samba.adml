      <string id="POL_3CD2A970_826E_518E_B5F0_5E6725FF354D_Help">This global parameter allows the Samba admin
 to limit what interfaces on a machine will serve SMB requests. It
 affects file service smbd
 8 and name service nmbd
 8 in a slightly different ways.
 For name service it causes nmbd to bind to ports 137 and 138 on the interfaces listed in the parameter. nmbd also binds to the &quot;all addresses&quot; interface (0.0.0.0) on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes of reading broadcast messages. If this option is not set then nmbd will service name requests on all of these sockets. If is set then nmbd will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don't match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the parameter list. As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows nmbd to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the list. IP Source address spoofing does defeat this simple check, however, so it must not be used seriously as a security feature for nmbd.
 For file service it causes smbd 8 to bind only to the interface list given in the parameter. This restricts the networks that smbd will serve, to packets coming in on those interfaces. Note that you should not use this parameter for machines that are serving PPP or other intermittent or non-broadcast network interfaces as it will not cope with non-permanent interfaces.
 If is set and the network address 127.0.0.1 is not added to the parameter list smbpasswd 8 may not work as expected due to the reasons covered below.
 To change a users SMB password, the smbpasswd by default connects to the localhost - 127.0.0.1 address as an SMB client to issue the password change request. If is set then unless the network address 127.0.0.1 is added to the parameter list then smbpasswd will fail to connect in it's default mode. smbpasswd can be forced to use the primary IP interface of the local host by using its smbpasswd 8 -r remote machine parameter, with remote machine set to the IP name of the primary interface of the local host.</string>

By default Samba will query the kernel for the list of all active interfaces and use any interfaces except 127.0.0.1 that are broadcast capable.
 The option takes a list of interface strings. Each string can be in any of the following forms:
  a network interface name (such as eth0).  This may include shell-like wildcards so eth* will match  any interface starting with the substring &quot;eth&quot;     an IP address. In this case the netmask is  determined from the list of interfaces obtained from the  kernel     an IP/mask pair.     a broadcast/mask pair.
 The &quot;mask&quot; parameters can either be a bit length (such as 24 for a C class network) or a full netmask in dotted decimal form.
 The &quot;IP&quot; parameters above can either be a full dotted decimal IP address or a hostname which will be looked up via the OS's normal hostname resolution mechanisms.
 By default Samba enables all active interfaces that are broadcast capable except the loopback adaptor (IP address 127.0.0.1).
 In order to support SMB3 multi-channel configurations, smbd understands some extra parameters which can be appended after the actual interface with this extended syntax (note that the quoting is important in order to handle the ; and , characters):
 &quot;interface[;key1=value1[,key2=value2[...]]]&quot;
 Known keys are speed, capability, and if_index. Speed is specified in bits per second. Known capabilities are RSS and RDMA. The if_index should be used with care: the values must not coincide with indexes used by the kernel. Note that these options are mainly intended for testing and development rather than for production use. At least on Linux systems, these values should be auto-detected, but the settings can serve as last a resort when autodetection is not working or is not available. The specified values overwrite the auto-detected values.
 The first two example below configures three network interfaces corresponding to the eth0 device and IP addresses 192.168.2.10 and 192.168.3.10. The netmasks of the latter two interfaces would be set to 255.255.255.0.
 The other examples show how per interface extra parameters can be specified. Notice the possible usage of &quot;,&quot; and &quot;;&quot;, which makes the double quoting necessary.

Example: eth0 192.168.2.10/24 192.168.3.10/255.255.255.0

The second enhancement consists of a regular randomised browse synchronization with all currently known DMBs.

This option will instead directly manipulate the ldap tree to create, remove and modify user and group entries. This option also requires a running winbindd as it is used to allocate new uids/gids on user/group creation. The allocation range must be therefore configured.
 To use this option, a basic ldap tree must be provided and the ldap suffix parameters must be properly configured. On virgin servers the default users and groups (Administrator, Guest, Domain Users, Domain Admins, Domain Guests) can be precreated with the command net sam provision. To run this command the ldap server must be running, Winbindd must be running and the smb.conf ldap options must be properly configured.
 The typical ldap setup used with the yes option is usually sufficient to use yes as well.
 An example configuration can be the following:
 encrypt passwords = true passdb backend = ldapsam
 ldapsam:trusted=yes ldapsam:editposix=yes
 ldap admin dn = cn=admin,dc=samba,dc=org ldap delete dn = yes ldap group suffix = ou=groups ldap idmap suffix = ou=idmap ldap machine suffix = ou=computers ldap user suffix = ou=users ldap suffix = dc=samba,dc=org
 idmap backend = ldap:&quot;ldap://localhost&quot;

      <string id="POL_F7979912_0010_5656_BC3A_08876A56418C_Help">By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization.
 To make Samba scale well in large environments, the yes option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object. If these assumptions are met, yes can be activated and Samba can bypass the NSS system to query user group memberships. Optimized LDAP queries can greatly speed up domain logon and administration tasks. Depending on the size of the LDAP database a factor of 100 or more for common queries is easily achieved.</string>

 Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are created for all users accessing files on this server. For sites that use Windows NT account databases as their primary user database creating these users and keeping the user list in sync with the Windows NT PDC is an onerous task. This option allows smbd to create the required UNIX users ON DEMAND when a user accesses the Samba server.
 When the Windows user attempts to access the Samba server, at login (session setup in the SMB protocol) time, smbd 8 contacts the and attempts to authenticate the given user with the given password. If the authentication succeeds then smbd attempts to find a UNIX user in the UNIX password database to map the Windows user into. If this lookup fails, and is set then smbd will call the specified script AS ROOT, expanding any %u argument to be the user name to create.
 If this script successfully creates the user then smbd will continue on as though the UNIX user already existed. In this way, UNIX users are dynamically created to match existing Windows NT accounts.

   net use /home but use the whole string when dealing with profiles.

It also specifies the directory from which the &quot;Application Data&quot;, desktop, start menu, network neighborhood, programs and other folders, and their contents, are loaded and displayed on your Windows NT client.
 The share and the path must be readable by the user for the preferences and directories to be loaded onto the Windows NT client. The share must be writeable when the user logs in for the first time, in order that the Windows NT client can create the NTuser.dat and other directories. Thereafter, the directories and any of the contents can, if required, be made read-only. It is not advisable that the NTuser.dat file be made read-only - rename it to NTuser.man to achieve the desired effect (a MANdatory profile).
 Windows clients can sometimes maintain a connection to the [homes] share, even though there is no user logged in. Therefore, it is vital that the logon path does not include a reference to the homes share (i.e. setting this parameter to \\%N\homes\profile_path will cause problems).

 Do not quote the value. Setting this as \\%N\profile\%U will break profile handling. Where the tdbsam or ldapsam passdb backend is used, at the time the user account is created the value configured for this parameter is written to the passdb backend and that value will over-ride the parameter value present in the smb.conf file.

 Note that this option is only useful if Samba is set up as a domain controller.
 Disable the use of roaming profiles by setting the value of this parameter to the empty string. For example, &quot;&quot;.

Choosing the right balance for this value is very tricky, because on a busy cluster long service times to transfer something across the cluster might be valid. Setting it too short will degrade the service your cluster presents, setting it too long might make the cluster itself not recover from something severely broken for too long. Be aware that if you set this parameter, this needs to be in the file smb.conf, it is not really helpful to put this into a registry configuration (typical on a cluster), because to access the registry contact to ctdb is required.

 This would normally be a command that would deliver the message somehow. How this is to be done is up to your imagination.
 An example is:

message command = csh -c 'xedit %s;rm %s' &amp;

 This delivers the message using xedit, then removes it afterwards. NOTE THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS COMMAND RETURN IMMEDIATELY. That's why I have the '&amp;' on the end. If it doesn't return immediately then your PCs may freeze when sending messages (they should recover after 30 seconds, hopefully).
 All messages are delivered as the global guest user. The command takes the standard substitutions, although %u won't work (%U may be better in this case).
 Apart from the standard substitutions, some additional ones apply. In particular:
     %s = the filename containing    the message.          %t = the destination that    the message was sent to (probably the server name).
     %f = who the message    is from.

 Here's a way of sending the messages as mail to root:

message command = /bin/mail -s 'message from %f on %m' root &lt; %s; rm %s

 If you don't have a message command then the message won't be delivered and Samba will tell the sender there was an error. Unfortunately WfWg totally ignores the error code and carries on regardless, saying that the message was delivered.

 This is useful if you want your Samba server and all local clients to appear in a remote workgroup for which the normal browse propagation rules don't work. The remote workgroup can be anywhere that you can send IP packets to.
 For example:

 Two possible values are currently supported:  disabled  fork
 The classic method is to run rpc services as internal daemons embedded in smbd, therefore the external daemons are disabled by default.
 Choosing the fork option will cause samba to fork a separate process for each daemon configured this way. Each daemon may in turn fork a number of children used to handle requests from multiple smbds and direct tcp/ip connections (if the Endpoint Mapper is enabled). Communication with smbd happens over named pipes and require that said pipes are forward to the external daemon (see ).
 Forked RPC Daemons support dynamically forking children to handle connections. The heuristics about how many children to keep around and how fast to allow them to fork and also how many clients each child is allowed to handle concurrently is defined by parametrical options named after the daemon. Five options are currently supported:  prefork_min_children  prefork_max_children  prefork_spawn_rate  prefork_max_allowed_clients  prefork_child_min_life
 To set one of these options use the following syntax: daemonname:prefork_min_children = 5

  Three possible values currently supported are:  embedded  external  disabled
  The classic method is to run every pipe as an internal function  embedded in smbd. The defaults may vary  depending on the service.
  Choosing the external option allows one to run  a separate daemon or even a completely independent (3rd party)  server capable of interfacing with samba via the MS-RPC  interface over named pipes.
  Currently in Samba3 we support four daemons, spoolssd, epmd,  lsasd and mdssd. These daemons can be enabled using the  rpc_daemon option. For spoolssd you have  to enable the daemon and proxy the named pipe with:

 exists. If the sharename is still invalid, then smbd

 To use the CUPS printing interface set printcap name = cups . This should be supplemented by an additional setting cups in the [global] section. printcap name = cups will use the &quot;dummy&quot; printcap created by CUPS, as specified in your CUPS configuration file.


 On System V systems that use lpstat to
 list available printers you can use printcap name = lpstat
 to automatically obtain lists of available printers. This
 is the default for systems that define SYSV at configure time in
 Samba (this includes most System V based systems). If
 printcap name is set to lpstat on
 these systems then Samba will launch lpstat -v and
 attempt to parse the output to obtain a printer list.

 A minimal printcap file would look something like this:

print1|My Printer 1
print2|My Printer 2
print3|My Printer 3
print4|My Printer 4
print5|My Printer 5

 where the '|' separates aliases of a printer. The fact that the second alias has a space in it gives a hint to Samba that it's a comment.

 Under AIX the default printcap name is /etc/qconfig. Samba will assume the file is in AIX qconfig format if the string qconfig appears in the printcap filename.

 to resolve host names to IP addresses. Its main purpose to is to
 control how netbios name resolution is performed. The option takes a space
 separated string of name resolution options.

 The options are: &quot;lmhosts&quot;, &quot;host&quot;,
 &quot;wins&quot; and &quot;bcast&quot;. They cause names to be
 resolved as follows:

  lmhosts : Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file. If the line in lmhosts has no name type attached to the NetBIOS name (see the manpage for lmhosts for details) then any name type matches for lookup.
  host : Do a standard host name to IP address resolution, using the system  /etc/hosts , NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name resolution is  operating system depended for instance on IRIX or Solaris this may be controlled by the /etc/nsswitch.conf file. Note that this method is used only if the NetBIOS name  type being queried is the 0x20 (server) name type or 0x1c (domain controllers). The latter case is only  useful for active directory domains and results in a DNS query for the SRV RR entry matching  _ldap._tcp.domain.
 wins : Query a name with the IP address listed in the wins server parameter. If no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored.
 bcast : Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces listed in the parameter. This is the least reliable of the name resolution methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally connected subnet.


 The example below will cause the local lmhosts file to be examined
 first, followed by a broadcast attempt, followed by a normal
 system hostname lookup.

 When Samba is functioning in ADS security mode (security = ads)
 it is advised to use following settings for name resolve order:

 name resolve order = wins bcast

 DC lookups will still be done via DNS, but fallbacks to netbios names will  not inundate your DNS servers with needless queries for DOMAIN&lt;0x1c&gt; lookups.

 unless a registry entry is changed. To use encrypted passwords in
 Samba see the chapter &quot;User Database&quot; in the Samba HOWTO Collection.



 MS Windows clients that expect Microsoft encrypted passwords and that
 do not have plain text password support enabled will be able to
 connect only to a Samba server that has encrypted password support
 enabled and for which the user accounts have a valid encrypted password.
 Refer to the smbpasswd command man page for information regarding the
 creation of encrypted passwords for user accounts.



 The use of plain text passwords is NOT advised as support for this feature
 is no longer maintained in Microsoft Windows products. If you want to use
 plain text passwords you must set this parameter to no.


 In order for encrypted passwords to work correctly
 smbd
 8 must either
 have access to a local smbpasswd
 5 file (see the smbpasswd
 8 program for information on how to set up
 and maintain this file), or set the [domain|ads] parameter which
 causes smbd to authenticate against another server.</string>

 for this parameter.


 On some systems the default guest account &quot;nobody&quot; may not
 be able to print. Use another account in this case. You should test
 this by trying to log in as your guest user (perhaps by using the
 su - command) and trying to print using the

      <string id="POL_75BBDBCB_46D1_55DE_9A7C_9EEA7DD026BF_Help">This parameter determines the encryption types to use when operating
 as a Kerberos client. Possible values are all,
 strong, and legacy.


 Samba uses a Kerberos library (MIT or Heimdal) to obtain Kerberos
 tickets. This library is normally configured outside of Samba, using
 the krb5.conf file. This file may also include directives to configure
 the encryption types to be used. However, Samba implements Active Directory
 protocols and algorithms to locate a domain controller. In order to
 force the Kerberos library into using the correct domain controller,
 some Samba processes, such as
 winbindd
 8 and
 net
 8, build a private krb5.conf
 file for use by the Kerberos library while being invoked from Samba.
 This private file controls all aspects of the Kerberos library operation,
 and this parameter controls how the encryption types are configured
 within this generated file, and therefore also controls the encryption
 types negotiable by Samba.


 When set to all, all active directory
 encryption types are allowed.


 When set to strong, only AES-based encryption
 types are offered. This can be used in hardened environments to prevent
 downgrade attacks.


 When set to legacy, only RC4-HMAC-MD5
 is allowed. Avoiding AES this way has one a very specific use.
 Normally, the encryption type is negotiated between the peers.
 However, there is one scenario in which a Windows read-only domain
 controller (RODC) advertises AES encryption, but then proxies the
 request to a writeable DC which may not support AES encryption,
 leading to failure of the handshake. Setting this parameter to
 legacy would cause samba not to negotiate AES
 encryption. It is assumed of course that the weaker legacy
 encryption types are acceptable for the setup.</string>

 lanman auth = no

 This parameter determines whether or not smbd
 8 will attempt to
 authenticate users or permit password changes
 using the LANMAN password hash. If disabled, only clients which support NT
 password hashes (e.g. Windows NT/2000 clients, smbclient, but not
 Windows 95/98 or the MS DOS network client) will be able to
 connect to the Samba host.

 The LANMAN encrypted response is easily broken, due to its
 case-insensitive nature, and the choice of algorithm. Servers
 without Windows 95/98/ME or MS DOS clients are advised to disable
 this option.

 When this parameter is set to no this
 will also result in sambaLMPassword in Samba's passdb being
 blanked after the next password change. As a result of that
 lanman clients won't be able to authenticate, even if lanman
 auth is re-enabled later on.

 Unlike the encrypt
 passwords option, this parameter cannot alter client
 behaviour, and the LANMAN response will still be sent over the

 auth to disable this for Samba's clients (such as smbclient)

 This parameter is overridden by ntlm

Helpdesk services will hate you if you set the map to guest parameter this way :-). Bad Uid - Is only applicable when Samba is configured in some type of domain mode security (security = {domain|ads}) and means that user logins which are successfully authenticated but which have no valid Unix user account (and smbd is unable to create one) should be mapped to the defined guest account. This was the default behavior of Samba 2.x releases. Note that if a member server is running winbindd, this option should never be required because the nss_winbind library will export the Windows domain users and groups to the underlying OS via the Name Service Switch interface.


 Note that this parameter is needed to set up &quot;Guest&quot;
 share services. This is because in these modes the name of the resource being
 requested is not sent to the server until after
 the server has successfully authenticated the client so the server
 cannot make authentication decisions at the correct time (connection
 to the share) for &quot;Guest&quot; shares.

 Note that this parameter only is used if the parameter is set to yes. This sequence is

 The chat sequence can also contain the standard macros
 \n, \r, \t and \s to give line-feed, carriage-return, tab

 This is the default security setting in Samba, and causes Samba to consult
 the parameter (if set) to determine the security mode.

 SECURITY = USER

 If is not specified, this is the default security setting in Samba.
 With user-level security a client must first &quot;log-on&quot; with a
 valid username and password (which can be mapped using the
 parameter). Encrypted passwords (see the parameter) can also
 be used in this security mode. Parameters such as and if set are then applied and
 may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after

 See the parameter for details on doing this.

 SECURITY = DOMAIN

 This mode will only work correctly if net
 8 has been used to add this
 machine into a Windows NT Domain. It expects the parameter to be set to yes. In this
 mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing
 it to a Windows NT Primary or Backup Domain Controller, in exactly
 the same way that a Windows NT Server would do.

 Note that a valid UNIX user must still
 exist as well as the account on the Domain Controller to allow
 Samba to have a valid UNIX account to map file access to.

 Note that from the client's point
 of view security = domain is the same
 as security = user. It only
 affects how the server deals with the authentication,
 it does not in any way affect what the client sees.

 See also the parameter and the parameter.
 SECURITY = ADS In this mode, Samba will act as a domain member in an ADS realm. To operate  in this mode, the machine running Samba will need to have Kerberos installed  and configured and Samba will need to be joined to the ADS realm using the  net utility. Note that this mode does NOT make Samba operate as a Active Directory Domain  Controller.
 Note that this forces yes and yes for the primary domain.

 server and is one of the most important settings in the smb.conf file.

 The default is server role = auto, as causes
 Samba to operate according to the setting, or if not
 specified as a simple file server that is not connected to any domain.

 The alternatives are
 server role = standalone or server role = member server
 , which support joining Samba to a Windows domain, along with server role = domain controller, which run Samba as a Windows domain controller.

 You should use server role = standalone and
 if you
 want to mainly setup shares without a password (guest shares). This
 is commonly used for a shared printer server.
 SERVER ROLE = AUTO

 This is the default server role in Samba, and causes Samba to consult
 the parameter (if set) to determine the server role, giving compatible behaviours to previous Samba versions.

 SERVER ROLE = STANDALONE

 If is also not specified, this is the default security setting in Samba.
 In standalone operation, a client must first &quot;log-on&quot; with a
 valid username and password (which can be mapped using the
 parameter) stored on this machine. Encrypted passwords (see the parameter) are by default
 used in this security mode. Parameters such as and if set are then applied and
 may change the UNIX user to use on this connection, but only after
 the user has been successfully authenticated.

 SERVER ROLE = MEMBER SERVER

 This mode will only work correctly if net
 8 has been used to add this
 machine into a Windows Domain. It expects the parameter to be set to yes. In this
 mode Samba will try to validate the username/password by passing
 it to a Windows or Samba Domain Controller, in exactly
 the same way that a Windows Server would do.

 Note that a valid UNIX user must still
 exist as well as the account on the Domain Controller to allow
 Samba to have a valid UNIX account to map file access to. Winbind can provide this.

 SERVER ROLE = CLASSIC PRIMARY DOMAIN CONTROLLER

 This mode of operation runs a classic Samba primary domain
 controller, providing domain logon services to Windows and Samba
 clients of an NT4-like domain. Clients must be joined to the domain to
 create a secure, trusted path across the network. There must be
 only one PDC per NetBIOS scope (typcially a broadcast network or
 clients served by a single WINS server).

 SERVER ROLE = CLASSIC BACKUP DOMAIN CONTROLLER

 This mode of operation runs a classic Samba backup domain
 controller, providing domain logon services to Windows and Samba
 clients of an NT4-like domain. As a BDC, this allows
 multiple Samba servers to provide redundant logon services to a
 single NetBIOS scope.

 SERVER ROLE = ACTIVE DIRECTORY DOMAIN CONTROLLER

 This mode of operation runs Samba as an active directory
 domain controller, providing domain logon services to Windows and
 Samba clients of the domain. This role requires special
 configuration, see the Samba4

      <string id="POL_086EBC7E_1D72_5C67_9447_F5F6E36EFA8F_Help">This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server. This can be used for several purposes. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files.

 Please note that for user mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified entries in the map table (e.g. biddle = DOMAIN\foo).

 The map file is parsed line by line. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a '=' followed by a list of usernames on the right. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group. The special client name '*' is a wildcard and matches any name. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long.

 The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the '=' signs. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left. Processing then continues with the next line.

 If any line begins with a '#' or a ';' then it is ignored.

 If any line begins with an '!' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed. Using '!' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file.

 For example to map from the name admin or administrator to the UNIX name root you would use:

root = admin administrator
 Or to map anyone in the UNIX group system to the UNIX name sys you would use:

sys = @system


 You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file.


 If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the /etc/group database for matching groups.

 You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name. For example:

tridge = &quot;Andrew Tridgell&quot;

 would map the windows username &quot;Andrew Tridgell&quot; to the unix username &quot;tridge&quot;.

 The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest. Note the use of the
 '!' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:

!sys = mary fred
guest = *



 Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames. Thus if you connect to \\server\fred and fred is remapped to mary then you will actually be connecting to \\server\mary and will need to supply a password suitable for mary not fred. The only exception to this is the username passed to a Domain Controller (if you have one). The DC will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification.


 Also note that no reverse mapping is done. The main effect this has is with printing. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don't own the print job.

 Samba versions prior to 3.0.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e.g.: DOMAIN\user) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server.



 The following functionality is obeyed in version 3.0.8 and later:



 When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate
 the connection.



 When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map
 to the fully qualified username (i.e. DOMAIN\user) only after the user has been successfully authenticated.

      <string id="POL_93A78BFD_8C1E_5643_8329_A90FF5CE5A6B_Help">Modern server operating systems are tuned for high
 network performance in the majority of situations; when you set socket
 options you are overriding those settings. Linux in particular has an
 auto-tuning mechanism for buffer sizes that will be disabled if you
 specify a socket buffer size. This can potentially cripple your
 TCP/IP stack.

 Getting the socket options correct can make a big difference to
 your performance, but getting them wrong can degrade it by just as
 much. As with any other low level setting, if you must make changes
 to it, make small changes and test the effect
 before making any large changes.



 This option allows you to set socket options
 to be used when talking with the client.

 Socket options are controls on the networking layer
 of the operating systems which allow the connection to be
 tuned.

 This option will typically be used to tune your Samba server
 for optimal performance for your local network. There is no way
 that Samba can know what the optimal parameters are for your net,
 so you must experiment and choose them yourself. We strongly
 suggest you read the appropriate documentation for your operating
 system first (perhaps man
 setsockopt will help).

 You may find that on some systems Samba will say
 &quot;Unknown socket option&quot; when you supply an option. This means you
 either incorrectly typed it or you need to add an include file
 to includes.h for your OS. If the latter is the case please
 send the patch to
 samba-technical@lists.samba.org.

 Any of the supported socket options may be combined
 in any way you like, as long as your OS allows it.

 This is the list of socket options currently settable
 using this option:


  SO_KEEPALIVE
  SO_REUSEADDR
  SO_BROADCAST
  TCP_NODELAY TCP_KEEPCNT * TCP_KEEPIDLE * TCP_KEEPINTVL *
  IPTOS_LOWDELAY
  IPTOS_THROUGHPUT SO_REUSEPORT
  SO_SNDBUF *
  SO_RCVBUF *
  SO_SNDLOWAT *
  SO_RCVLOWAT * SO_SNDTIMEO * SO_RCVTIMEO * TCP_FASTACK * TCP_QUICKACK TCP_NODELAYACK TCP_KEEPALIVE_THRESHOLD * TCP_KEEPALIVE_ABORT_THRESHOLD * TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT * TCP_USER_TIMEOUT *


 Those marked with a '*' take an integer
 argument. The others can optionally take a 1 or 0 argument to enable
 or disable the option, by default they will be enabled if you
 don't specify 1 or 0.

 To specify an argument use the syntax SOME_OPTION = VALUE
 for example SO_SNDBUF = 8192. Note that you must
 not have any spaces before or after the = sign.

 If you are on a local network then a sensible option
 might be:

 socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY

 If you have a local network then you could try:

 socket options = IPTOS_LOWDELAY TCP_NODELAY

 If you are on a wide area network then perhaps try
 setting IPTOS_THROUGHPUT.

 Note that several of the options may cause your Samba  server to fail completely. Use these options with caution!

For example, whether the name &quot;Space Kadet&quot; should be replaced with the string &quot;space_kadet&quot;. Frequently Unix shell scripts will have difficulty with usernames contains whitespace due to the default field separator in the shell. If your domain possesses names containing the underscore character, this option may cause problems unless the name aliasing feature is supported by your nss_info plugin.

 This feature also enables the name aliasing API which can be used to make domain user and group names to a non-qualified version. Please refer to the manpage for the configured idmap and nss_info plugin for the specifics on how to configure name aliasing for a specific configuration. Name aliasing takes precedence (and is mutually exclusive) over the whitespace replacement mechanism discussed previously.
