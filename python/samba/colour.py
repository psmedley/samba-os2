# The 4 bit colours are available as global variables with names like
# RED, DARK_RED, REV_RED (for red background), and REV_DARK_RED. If
# switch_colour_off() is called, these names will all point to the
# empty string. switch_colour_on() restores the default values.
#
# The 256-colour codes are obtained using xterm_256_color(n), where n
# is the number of the desired colour.

# to bake in the name of the colour but not its actual value.
