  Intellectual Property Rights Notice for Open Specifications Documentation

  * Technical Documentation. Microsoft publishes Open Specifications
    documentation (“this documentation”) for protocols, file formats,
    data portability, computer languages, and standards
    support. Additionally, overview documents cover inter-protocol
    relationships and interactions.

  * Copyrights. This documentation is covered by Microsoft
    copyrights. Regardless of any other terms that are contained in
    the terms of use for the Microsoft website that hosts this
    documentation, you can make copies of it in order to develop
    implementations of the technologies that are described in this
    documentation and can distribute portions of it in your
    implementations that use these technologies or in your
    documentation as necessary to properly document the
    implementation. You can also distribute in your implementation,
    with or without modification, any schemas, IDLs, or code samples
    that are included in the documentation. This permission also
    applies to any documents that are referenced in the Open
    Specifications documentation.

  * No Trade Secrets. Microsoft does not claim any trade secret rights
    in this documentation.

  * Patents. Microsoft has patents that might cover your
    implementations of the technologies described in the Open
    Specifications documentation. Neither this notice nor Microsoft's
    delivery of this documentation grants any licenses under those
    patents or any other Microsoft patents.  However, a given Open
    Specifications document might be covered by the Microsoft Open
    Specifications Promise or the Microsoft Community Promise. If you
    would prefer a written license, or if the technologies described
    in this documentation are not covered by the Open Specifications
    Promise or Community Promise, as applicable, patent licenses are
    available by contacting iplg@microsoft.com.

  * License Programs. To see all of the protocols in scope under a
    specific license program and the associated patents, visit the
    Patent Map.

  * Trademarks. The names of companies and products contained in this
    documentation might be covered by trademarks or similar
    intellectual property rights. This notice does not grant any
    licenses under those rights. For a list of Microsoft trademarks,
    visit www.microsoft.com/trademarks.

  * Fictitious Names. The example companies, organizations, products,
    domain names, email addresses, logos, people, places, and events
    that are depicted in this documentation are fictitious.  No
    association with any real company, organization, product, domain
    name, email address, logo, person, place, or event is intended or
    should be inferred.

  Reservation of Rights. All other rights are reserved, and this notice
  does not grant any rights other than as specifically described above,
  whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

  Tools. The Open Specifications documentation does not require the use
  of Microsoft programming tools or programming environments in order
  for you to develop an implementation. If you have access to Microsoft
  programming tools and environments, you are free to take advantage of
  them. Certain Open Specifications documents are intended for use in
  conjunction with publicly available standards specifications and
  network programming art and, as such, assume that the reader either
  is familiar with the aforementioned material or has immediate access
  to it.

  Support. For questions and support, please contact dochelp@microsoft.com
